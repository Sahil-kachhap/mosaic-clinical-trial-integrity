        "Flag a study as missing results ONLY if status is COMPLETED "
        "and results_posted is False and more than 12 months have "
        "passed since the completion date.",
        # WHY 12 MONTHS?
        # By US law (FDAAA 801), sponsors must post results within
        # 12 months of the primary completion date. We do not flag
        # studies that have not yet hit this deadline.

        "Do NOT flag studies with status TERMINATED as missing results. "
        "Terminated trials are not legally required to post results "
        "in all circumstances — termination often means the study "

        # terminated trials look like they have missing results
        # but they are often exempt from the posting requirement.

        "A study that never really started may not have reportable results.",

        "Always check the sponsor's track record before assigning "
        "a confidence score. A first-time missing result from a "
        "historically compliant sponsor warrants lower confidence "
        "than the same finding from a repeat offender.",

    "broken_promises_agent": [

        "after enrollment has begun. Changes to secondary outcomes "

        # Changing secondary outcomes is far more common and acceptable.

        "reduce confidence to 0.5. We do not have enough data to "
        "make a reliable judgment about their track record.",

        "Always distinguish between a sponsor's PRIMARY studies "

        "for their primary studies.",

    "pattern_finder_agent": [
        "A cross-study pattern requires at least 3 studies to be "
        "meaningful. Two studies with similar issues may be coincidence. "
        "Three or more is a pattern worth flagging.",

        "When multiple companies are testing the same drug for the "
        "same condition, check whether any of them have hidden "
        "negative results from previous studies in our database.",

        "A drug that failed Phase 2 for condition A but is being "
        "retried in Phase 2 for condition B is worth flagging — "
        "especially if the mechanism of action is the same.",

        "Patterns across the same SPONSOR are more actionable than "
        "patterns across different sponsors. Same-sponsor patterns "

        "AFTER the trial completed — not during it.",

        "Look specifically for cases where the filing says "
        "'no serious adverse events' but published papers mention "
        "hospitalisations, discontinuations, or deaths. "
        "This is the highest-priority safety signal.",

        "If the discrepancy is minor (e.g. different terminology "
        "for the same event), assign LOW confidence. "
        "If the discrepancy involves severity (mild vs serious), "
        "assign HIGH confidence.",

        "Always note whether the paper's authors are the same as "
        "the trial's investigators. Independent authors are more "
        "credible than sponsor-employed investigators.",

    "timeline_agent": [
        "Flag a delay ONLY if it exceeds 180 days beyond the "
        "stated completion date AND no amendment was filed explaining "
        "the extension. A silent delay is more suspicious than "
        "a disclosed one.",

        "COVID-19 is a legitimate reason for delays between "
        "March 2020 and December 2022. Do not flag delays in this "
        "period as suspicious without additional evidence.",

        "A study that is recruiting past its stated completion date "
        "may simply have underestimated enrollment time — this is "
        "common and not inherently suspicious. Focus on COMPLETED "
        "studies that are past their results posting deadline.",
